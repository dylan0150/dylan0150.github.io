	<p>No....Really...What am I doing? So these past few months i've been starting off with my photography project! I've been going round photographing lot's of musicians! It's been fun and stressful! But as one for my favourite musicians says 'But in the end journey's brought joys
That outweigh the pain.' So I guess that after all this I will look back and see the work i've done and be proud! That's what i'm hoping anyway!</p>

	<p>This whole project is to get the smaller, lesser known musicians around Manchester a good bit of promotion! It also gives me a chance to work with new musicians and different types of acts in hope to build up my portfolio! I'm working with many musicians from solo acts to bands! It has been loads of fun so far but it has also been taking over my life! This and starting my new job AND moving house! But as I said before, it will all be worth it in the end! </p>

	<p>I am hoping for this to last until mid September and then i can do a huge summary to send out to various music folk to get the musicians i'm working with some well deserved promotion! I will still continue a few gigs from September but i will have  to prioritise Uni and my job! Once I've worked out more into this wholo blog and vlogging i will be able to show you who i've been working with so far! </p>
